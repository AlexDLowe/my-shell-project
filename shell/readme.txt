                                                                 |
To get working simply type 'make' in your terminal, then '/.lsh' |
to actually start the shell program.                             |
                                                                 |

                                                                 |
                                                                 |
                                                                 |
*************1.1 COMMANDS WITH AND WITHOUT ARGUMENTS*************
                                                                 |
Self-explanatory, you can use commands from UNIX with or even    |
without arguments.                                               |
                                                                 |
***********1.2 EXECUTION OF COMMANDS IN THE BACKGROUND***********
                                                                 |
By placing '&' at the end of a command, this will cause it to    |
run in the background rather than the foreground.                |
                                                                 |
*******************1.3 IMPLEMENTATION OF PIPES*******************
                                                                 |
You can pipe two commands together allowing the flow of data     |
unilaterally.                                                    |
                                                                 |
****************1.4 IMPLEMENTATION OF REDIRECTION****************
                                                                 |
You can redirect the input and output of data to or from files.  |
                                                                 |
                                                                 |
************1.5 IMPLEMENTATION OF BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS*************
                                                                 |
Namely these are cd and exit.                                    |
                                                                 |
cd - used to change directory. cd .. for example.                |
exit - exits the program, simple.                                |
                                                                 |

**1.6 CATCHING & ALTERING OF SIGINT TO TERMINATE OUR PROCESSES***
                                                                 |
If you're not able to execue any commands you're entering, or    |
you can't enter commands at all, then pressing Ctrl+C, should    |
hopefully fix it for you.                                        |
                                                                 |
