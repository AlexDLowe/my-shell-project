			   COMMAND SHELL
			   =============

---- LOGISTICS ----

These questions will help us to keep track of the difficulty level of
assignments, as well as keeping track of which team members worked on
which parts.

>> L1: How many hours did each team member spend on this assignment?
   Make sure that each member's total time is listed.

Alexander:     38 - 40 hours
Muhammad:      38 - 40 hours

>> L2: What did each team member focus on for this assignment?  Keep
   descriptions to 25-30 words or less.

Alexander: Lab Specifications [2,3,4] - So background processes, the use of
           pipes and also implementing redirection.

Muhammad:  Lab Specifications [1,6] - So getting commands with and without
           arguments, and also the remapping of Ctrl+C to kill child
           processes rather than the process of lsh.

Joint:     Lab Specification [5] - Built-in commands of cd and exit.

			  SURVEY QUESTIONS
			  ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future years.  Feel free to tell us anything you want - these
questions are just to spur your thoughts.  Also, feel free to be completely
honest if there are issues with the assignment or the course - you won't be
penalized.  We can't fix things until we know about them.  :-)

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any of the parts of it, too
>> easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

   >> Our View: I believe this was WAY too hard, so my difficulty
                   comes from a signifcant lack of experience, where NONE of this
                   was taught or even recommended to be learned.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

   >> Our View: I would unequivocally say that getting piping working was
                   by far the most insightful and enriching part of this. So
                   difficult, but the thrill of completing it is the best.

>> Were there any parts of the assignment that you felt were unnecessarily
>> tedious or pointless?

   >> Our View:     Nope, all quite valid.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future quarters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

   >> Our View: Only misleading guidance was the fact that on the actual
                   pdf version of the Assignment brief it stated to use
                   lab1.tar.gz, which doesn't exist, but we made this apparent
                   in one of the lab sessions.

>> Do you have any suggestions for the instructor and/or TAs to more
>> effectively assist students, either for future quarters or the remaining
>> projects?

   >> Alex's View: Faster feedback time than "when you get your exam results",
                   this may be just how the education system is here in Sweden,
                   I don't know, but back in the UK (which does have an overall
                   poorer education system, I'll admit) we get assignments
                   graded and given with feedback within 2 weeks.
                   
   >> Muhammad's View: Further guidance for people who are new programming or
                       did it a long time ago, just to help get them started
                       and keep them on the right track.

>> Any other comments?

   >> Our View: Nope, got everything off my chest :D Overall, a fun challenge.
